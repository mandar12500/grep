Title of the Project : GREP
Name : Mandar Prafulla Kathane
MIS ID : 111708028
	I have implemented 12 modes (-c, -v, -h, -w -b, -H, -i, -m, -q, -f, -r, -e) of the grep command in my project.
	Also, the combinations of these command have been implemented. I have used character queue and a list in my project.
	I first found the modes which are present using a function and then I have found the index of files and patterns on the command line. The patterns are then passed to a function which indicates if carat or dollar is present in the pattern and does the conversions.The patterns are stored in a queue.The patterns and files are then passed to functions for matching, where the matched or unmatched (According to the modes present) are stored in a list and then the list is passed for printing.
